# Movie_Rental_Shop

## Introduction:

Hello! I'm happy to show you my SQL project. I've been working on this database for a movie rental shop using PostgreSQL and PgAdmin. The main goal is simple: I want to figure out how databases work and get better at writing SQL queries â€“ those special commands that tell databases what to do.

## Database

The database I'm working with came from Nikolai Schuler's class on Udemy called "Master SQL in just 15 days from Basics to Pro by working daily on real-life projects." 

In the course, there are also challenges to check what I've learned. In this repository, I'm sharing my answers to these challenges. The challenges in this project were like different levels in a game. Some were easy, and some were a bit trickier. But hey, I had fun figuring them out! It's like solving puzzles that helped me get better at using SQL.

## Big thank you

I've got to give a big thank you to Nikolai Shuler and his Udemy course. His lessons were like a guide through the SQL maze. Thanks to him, I was able to understand PostgreSQL and PgAdmin way better.
